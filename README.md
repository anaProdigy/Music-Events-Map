## 🎶🎤🎸🎶 Western Canadian Music Scene 🎶🎤🎸🎶


Are you interested in indie live music events? Maybe a large crowd or festival is more your scene? Then the Western Canadian Music Scene is the app for you! This full-stack, single-page web application allows users to collaboratively add upcoming music events as markers on an interactive map using the Leaflet API. Whether you are an event organizer, musician, or a fan, you can access all of the app's features. This includes being able to create, edit, and delete music events; view all events and relevant event information; search for events by city/location; toggle between multiple map types, as well as add any event to a list of favourites. 


No `gig` deal, just `Hip-Hop` to it and `Rock` on!
